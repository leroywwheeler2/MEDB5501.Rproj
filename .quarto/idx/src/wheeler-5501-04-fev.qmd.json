The program was written by Steve Simon on 2024-09-07 and is placed in the public domain.\n\n[dd]: https://github.com/pmean/datasets/blob/master/fev.yaml\n\n\nThe tidyverse library is the only one you need for  this program.\n\n```{r setup}\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n## List variable names\n\nSince the variable names are not listed in the data file itself, you need to list them here.\n\n```{r names}\npulmonary_names <- c(\n    \"age\",\n    \"fev\",\n    \"ht\",\n    \"sex\",\n    \"smoke\")\n```\n\n## Reading the data\n\nHere is the code to read the data and show a glimpse. \n\n```{r read}\npulmonary <- read_csv(\n  file=\"../data/fev.csv\",\n  col_names=pulmonary_names,\n  col_types=\"nnncc\")\nglimpse(pulmonary)\n```\n\n## Question 1: Update the program to calculate descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) for ht. Interpret these statistics.\n\n```{r descriptive-ht}\nsummary(pulmonary$ht)\nsd(pulmonary$ht)\n```\n\nThe mean height is about 61 inches with a standard deviation of almost 6 inches. Height ranges from 46 to 74 inches, which is consistent with a pediatric population.\n\n\n## Question 2: Draw a scatterplot of ht versus fev. Place ht on the x-axis and fev on the y-axis. Interpret this plot.\n\n\n```{r plot-ht-fev}\npulmonary |>\n  ggplot(aes(ht, fev)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth() +\n    xlab(\"Height (inches)\") +\n    ylab(\"Forced Expiratory Volume (Liters)\") +\n    ggtitle(\"Scatter plot drawn by Leroy Wheeler on 2024-09-11\")\n```\n\nThere is a positive linear association between height and fev. Calculation of r will likely confirm this observation.\n\n\n\n## Question 3: Calculate the correlation between ht and fev. Interpret this correlation.\n```{r correlation}\ncor(pulmonary$ht, pulmonary$fev)\n```\nA correlation value of r=0.87 confirms the strong positive relationship between height and fev in this data set.\n\n## Question 4: Calculate counts and percentages for sex. Please be sure to convert sex from the numeric codes into a factor. Interpret these statistics.\n\n```{r descriptive-sex}\npulmonary |>\n  count(sex) |>\n  mutate(total=sum(n)) |>\n  mutate(pct=round(100*n/total))\n```\nThe data set was roughly split in half according to sex with 51% males and 49% females.\n\n## Question 5: Draw a boxplot for sex and fev. Interpret this boxplot\n```{r plot-sex-fev}\npulmonary |>\n  ggplot(aes(sex, fev)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    xlab(\"Sex (F/M)\") +\n    ylab(\"Forced Expiratory Volume (Liters)\") +\n    ggtitle(\"Box plot drawn by Leroy Wheeler on 2024-09-11\")\n```\n\nThe fev values are a little larger for males when compared to females.  The variability for the male data is also slightly higher as well. These results are not surprising.\n\n## Question 6: Calculate the difference in average fev values between males and females. Is this a large or a small difference? Calculate the effect size by dividing by the standard deviation of the females. Is this a small, medium, or large effect size?\n\n```{r mean-fev-by-sex}\npulmonary |>\n  group_by(sex) |>\n  summarize(\n    mean_fev=mean(fev),\n    sd_fev=sd(fev))\n```\n\nThe average fev values for males is 2.8 which is larger than that observed in females, which is 2.5. Males also have a standard deviation of 1, which is also higher than the standard deviation of 0.6 seen in females.\n\nThe effect size between males and females is approximately 0.6 standard deviations.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nThis program assesses the relationships among variables in a study of pulmonary function in children.
