The default option for most plots is landscape orientation (the width is larger than the height). The q-q plot, however, looks best if figure width and height are equal.\n\n```{r qqplot-fev}\n#| fig-width: 5\n#| fig.height: 5\nqqnorm(fev$fev)\n```\n\nThe normal probability plot is reasonably close to a straight line, indicating that the data comes reasonably close to following a normal distribution.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nThis program assesses the normality of variables in a study of pulmonary function in children.
