The ANOVA table displays a large F value and a small p-value for our linear regression model, therefore we conclude that this weak relationship is likely true.\n\n\n\n```{r residual-scatterplot-1}\nm1 |>\n  ggplot(aes(price, .resid)) + \n    geom_point() +\n\t  ggtitle(\"Scatter of Residuals drawn by Leroy Wheeler on 2024-10-25\") +\n\t  xlab(\"Price of College Degree (USD)\") +\n\t  ylab(\"Residuals from m1\") \n```\n\nThis scatterplot displays the residual variation according to college price.

This linear model may be improved by a log transformation, however with our large sample size (n = 706), we should be able to safely ignore a little departure from normal distribution.\n\n\n```{r box plot-1}\nearnings |>\n  ggplot(aes(public, price)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    ggtitle(\"Graph drawn by Leroy Wheeler on 2024-10-22\") +\n    xlab(\"Public University\") +\n    ylab(\"Price paid for college degree (USD)\") +\n    coord_flip()\n```\nThe box plots show more variation in the price data in the private university attendees when compared to the public university attendees.
