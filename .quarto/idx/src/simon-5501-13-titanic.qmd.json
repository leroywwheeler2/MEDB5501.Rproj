Find more\ninformation in the [data dictionary][web00].\n\n[web00]: https://github.com/pmean/data/blob/main/files/titanic.yaml\n\nThis code was written by Steve Simon on 2024-11-09 and is placed in the public\ndomain.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: setup\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(epitools)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n#### Comments on the code\n\nFor most of your programs, you should load the [tidyverse library][web01]. The messages and warnings are suppressed.\n\n[web01]: https://www.tidyverse.org/\n\nIn previous programs, I put a label for each chunk inside the curly braces ({}).\nIt is recommended instead to put the label on a separate line inside the program\nchunk. It is a bit more work to provide a unique label for each chunk, but it\nhelps quite a bit to isolate where to look when your code produces an error.\n\n## Read the data and view a brief summary\n\n```{r}\n#| label: read\nti <- read_tsv(\n  file=\"../data/titanic.txt\",\n  col_names=TRUE,\n  col_types=\"ccncn\",\n  na=\"NA\")\nnames(ti) <- tolower(names(ti))\nglimpse(ti)\n```\n\n#### Comments on the code\n\nUse read_tsv from the [readr package][web02] to  read this file. Use \ncol_names=TRUE because the column names are included as the first row of the \nfile. The col_types=\"ccncn\" specifies the first second and fourth columns as\nstrings and the third and fifth as numeric. There are missing values in this\ndataset, designated by the letters \"NA\".\n\n[web02]: https://readr.tidyverse.org/\n\n## Replace numeric codes for survived\n\n```{r}\n#| label: replace-numbers\nti$survived <-\n\tfactor(\n\t\tti$survived,\n\t\tlevel=1:0,\n\t\tlabels=c(\"yes\", \"no\"))\n```\n\n#### Comments on the code\n\nThe [factor function][web03] places the levels of a categorical variable in a specific order and (optionally) attaches labels to each level. In this code, the\nnumber codes are reordered so that 1 appears first followed by 0. The labels \"yes\" and \"no\" are attached to these two codes.\n\n[web03]: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/factor.html\n\n## Get counts of sex by survival\n\n```{r}\n#| label: counts\ntable1 <-xtabs(~sex+survived, data=ti)\ntable1\n```\n\n#### Comments on the code\n\nThe [table function][web04] or the [xtabs function][web05] creates a matrix with the number of observations in each combination of sex and survived. The [count function][web06] provides an alternative where these values are placed in a single column. \n\n[web04]: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/table.html\n[web05]: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/xtabs.html\n[web06]: https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/count.html\n\n#### Interpretation of the output\n\nThere are 154 female passengers who died and 308 who survived. There are 709 male passengers who died and 142 who survived.\n\n## Get proportions for died/survived by sex\n\n```{r}\n#| label: proportions\ntable1 |>\n  proportions(\"sex\")\n```\n\n#### Comments on the code\n\nThe [proportions function][pro1] calculate proportions for a matrix, either by row (margin=1), by column (margin=2) or across all cells (margin=NULL). This code shows an alternative where you specify which variable to summarize across. The line proportions(\"sex\") tells R to compute totals for each level of sex and divide by those totals. In this case, since sex represents the rows of table1, R produces row percentages. This syntax is easier to remember than margin=1 and margin=2.\n\n[pro1]: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/proportions.html\n\n#### Interpretation of the output\n\nThe proportion of women who died is 33%. The proportion of men who died is much higher at 83%.\n\n## Bar chart\n\n```{r}\n#| label: bar\nti |>\n  ggplot() +\n    aes(x = sex, fill = survived) +\n    geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n\t  xlab(\"Sex\") +\n\t  ylab(\"Proportion\") +\n\t  ggtitle(\"Graph drawn by Steve Simon on 2024-11-11\")\n```\n\n#### Comments on the code\n\n#### Interpretation of the output\n\nI am not a big fan of bar charts, but they are quite popular. This bar chart shows a large disparity in the proportion who survived in each sex (the upper portion of the bar in peach). Equivalently, you can say that there is a large disparity in the proportion who died in each sex (the lower portion of the bar in green-blue). \n\n## Hypothesis test for two proportions\n\n```{r}\n#| label: equality-of-proportions\nprop.test(table1, correct=FALSE)\n```\n\n#### Comments on the code\n\nThe [prop.test function][pro2] does not work on raw data. You need to get summary counts, either from the table function or the xtabs function. The option correct=FALSE informs R to not use the [Yates continuity correction][yat1].\n\n[pro2]: https://search.r-project.org/R/refmans/stats/html/prop.test.html\n[yat1]: https://www.statskingdom.com/121proportion_normal2.html\n\n#### Interpretation of the output. \n\nThe Chi-squared statistic is much larger than the degrees of freedom and the\np-value is small. So you would reject the null hypothesis and conclude that \nthere is a statistically significant difference in the mortality rates between\nmen and women on the Titanic. The 95% confidence interval for the difference\nin proportions is -0.55 to -0.45. This interval excludes the value of zero and\nindicates that the mortality rate is at least 45% lower and possibly as much as\n55% lower for men.\n\n## Power calculation\n\n```{r}\n#| label: power\npower.prop.test(p1=0.17, p2=0.67, power=0.9)\n```\n\n```{r}\npower.prop.test(\np1=0.10,\np2=0.20,\npower=0.9,\nsig.level=0.05)\n```\n#### Comments on the code\n\nThe [power.prop.test][pow1] function will compute a sample size if you specify \nthe two group probabilities, the significance level, and the power. It will also\ndo other calculations, such as the minimum difference in probabilities that you\ncould detect for a specific sample size and a specific power.\n\n[pow1]: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/power.prop.test.html\n\n#### Interpretation of the output\n\nClearly, a sample size of 1,313 passengers provided more than enough power and\nprecision, especially considering that the difference in survival rates was so\nlarge. Out of curiosity, what sample size would still be adequate for testing a\nshift of 50% from a survival rate of 17% to a survival rate of 67%? If you \nwanted power to be at least 90%, then a sample size of only 19 passengers of \neach sex would be needed.\n\n## Chi-squared test\n\n```{r}\n#| label: chi-square-test\nchisq.test(table1, correct=FALSE)\n```\n\n#### Comments on the code\n\nThe [chisq.test function][chi1] calculates a chi-square test of independence. It\ntakes input in a variety of forms. In this example, it uses a crosstabulation\ncomputed by the xtabs command as input.\n\nThis function also will run a goodness-of-fit test, which is not discussed in \nthis lecture.\n\n[chi1]: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/chisq.test.html\n\n#### Interpretation of the output\n\nThe chi-squared statistic is much larger than the degrees of freedom and the\np-value is small. You should reject the null hypothesis and conclude that sex\nand survival are related (not independent)\n\n## Fisher's Exact test\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fishers-exact\nfisher.test(table1)\n```\n\n#### Comments on the code\n\nThe [fisher.test function][fis1] calculates the Fisher's exact test, which is\nhelpful for small sample sizes. The 1,313 passengers on the Titanic do not\nconstitute a small sample size by any means. This test is just shown as an \nexample of how to calculate this test. \n\n[fis1]: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/fisher.test.html\n\n#### Interpretation of the output\n\nThe p-value is small. You should reject the null hypothesis and conclude that \nsex and survival are related (not independent). The estimated odds ratio is \n9.97. The confidence interval for the odds ratio excludes the value of 1 \nleading to the same conclusion. In fact, even after allowing for sampling error\nthat odds of survival are at least 7.6 times greater for women than for me.\n\n## Odds ratio calculation\n\n```{r}\n#| label: odds-ratio\noddsratio(table1)\n```\n\n#### Comments on the code\n\nThe oddsratio function and riskratio function (see below) are part of the \n[epitools library][epi1]. It produces an odds ratio and confidence interval \nand p-values associated with the Fisher's Exact test and the Chi-squared test of\nindependence.\n\n[epi1]: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/epitools/epitools.pdf\n\n#### Interpretation of the output\n\nWe are 95% confident that the odds ratio of survival for women versus men is at\nleast 7.7 and possibly as large as 13, after accounting for sampling error. \nThis interval excludes the value of 1, so you can conclude that the risk of \ndeath is much higher for men than for women. Equivalently you could conclude \nthat the odds of survival are much higher for women than for men.\n\n## Risk ratio calculation, 1\n\n```{r}\n#| label: risk-ratio-1\ntable1 |>\n  proportions(\"sex\")\n```\n\n#### Interpretation of the output\n\nBefore calculating the risk ratio, let's look at the row percentages one more \ntime. The probability of survival is around 2/3 for women and about 1/6 for men. This means that the risk ratio from a survival perspective is around 4 (2/3 divided by 1/6). The probability of death is 1/3 for females and about 5/6 for males. The risk ratio from a mortality perspective is 0.4 (1/3 divided by 5/6)\n\n## Risk ratio calculation, 2\n\n```{r}\n#| label: risk-ratio-2\nriskratio(table1)\n```\n\n#### Interpretation of the output\n\nThe risk ratio is comparing the probability of death between men and women. Men have 2.5 times higher probability of death compared to women. The confidence interval excludes the value of 1, indicating a statistically significant increase.\n\n## Risk ratio calculation, 3\n\n```{r}\n#| label: risk-ratio-3\nriskratio(table1, rev=\"columns\")\n```\n\n#### Interpretation of the output\n\nThe risk ratio is comparing the probability of survival between men and women. Men has one-fourth the probability of survival compared to women. The confidence interval excludes the value of 1, indicating that men have a statistically significantly lower probability of survival compared to women. \n\n## Save data for later use\n\n```{r save}\nsave(ti, file=\"../data/titanic.RData\")\n```\n\n#### Comments on the code\n\nIt is usually a good idea to [save][sav1] your data in an RData file to make it\neasier to retrieve this data later (with the [load function][loa1]).\n\n[sav1]: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/save.html\n[loa1]: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/save.html\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nThis program reads data on survival of passengers on the Titanic.
