There is a [data dictionary][dd] that provides more details about the data. The program was written by Steve Simon on 2024-09-07 and is placed in the public domain.\n\n[dd]: https://github.com/pmean/datasets/blob/master/fev.yaml\n\n## Libraries\n\nThe tidyverse library is the only one you need for  this program.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## List variable names\n\nSince the variable names are not listed in the data file itself, you need to list them here.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npulmonary_names <- c(\n    \"age\",\n    \"fev\",\n    \"ht\",\n    \"sex\",\n    \"smoke\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Reading the data\n\nHere is the code to read the data and show a glimpse. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npulmonary <- read_csv(\n  file=\"../data/fev.csv\",\n  col_names=pulmonary_names,\n  col_types=\"nnncc\")\nglimpse(pulmonary)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 654\nColumns: 5\n$ age   <dbl> 9, 8, 7, 9, 9, 8, 6, 6, 8, 9, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 5, 6, 9, 9, 5, 5…\n$ fev   <dbl> 1.708, 1.724, 1.720, 1.558, 1.895, 2.336, 1.919, 1.415, 1.987, 1…\n$ ht    <dbl> 57.0, 67.5, 54.5, 53.0, 57.0, 61.0, 58.0, 56.0, 58.5, 60.0, 53.0…\n$ sex   <chr> \"F\", \"F\", \"F\", \"M\", \"M\", \"F\", \"F\", \"F\", \"F\", \"F\", \"F\", \"M\", \"F\",…\n$ smoke <chr> \"N\", \"N\", \"N\", \"N\", \"N\", \"N\", \"N\", \"N\", \"N\", \"N\", \"N\", \"N\", \"N\",…\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Question 1: Update the program to calculate descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) for ht. Interpret these statistics.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(pulmonary$ht)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.

Height ranges from 46 to 74 inches, which is consistent with a pediatric population.\n\n\n## Question 2: Draw a scatterplot of ht versus fev. Place ht on the x-axis and fev on the y-axis. Interpret this plot.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npulmonary |>\n  ggplot(aes(ht, fev)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth() +\n    xlab(\"Height (inches)\") +\n    ylab(\"Forced Expiratory Volume (Liters)\") +\n    ggtitle(\"Scatter plot drawn by Leroy Wheeler on 2024-09-11\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](wheeler-5501-04-fev_files/figure-html/plot-ht-fev-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere is a positive linear association between height and fev. Calculation of r will likely confirm this observation.\n\n\n\n## Question 3: Calculate the correlation between ht and fev. Interpret this correlation.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncor(pulmonary$ht, pulmonary$fev)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.868135\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nA correlation value of r=0.87 confirms the strong positive relationship between height and fev in this data set.\n\n## Question 4: Calculate counts and percentages for sex. Please be sure to convert sex from the numeric codes into a factor. Interpret these statistics.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npulmonary |>\n  count(sex) |>\n  mutate(total=sum(n)) |>\n  mutate(pct=round(100*n/total))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  sex       n total   pct\n  <chr> <int> <int> <dbl>\n1 F       318   654    49\n2 M       336   654    51\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nThe data set was roughly split in half according to sex with 51% males and 49% females.\n\n## Question 5: Draw a boxplot for sex and fev. Interpret this boxplot\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npulmonary |>\n  ggplot(aes(sex, fev)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    xlab(\"Sex (F/M)\") +\n    ylab(\"Forced Expiratory Volume (Liters)\") +\n    ggtitle(\"Box plot drawn by Leroy Wheeler on 2024-09-11\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](wheeler-5501-04-fev_files/figure-html/plot-sex-fev-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe fev values are a little larger for males when compared to females.  The variability for the male data is also slightly higher as well. These results are not surprising.\n\n## Question 6: Calculate the difference in average fev values between males and females. Is this a large or a small difference? Calculate the effect size by dividing by the standard deviation of the females. Is this a small, medium, or large effect size?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npulmonary |>\n  group_by(sex) |>\n  summarize(\n    mean_fev=mean(fev),\n    sd_fev=sd(fev))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  sex   mean_fev sd_fev\n  <chr>    <dbl>  <dbl>\n1 F         2.45  0.646\n2 M         2.81  1.00 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe average fev values for males is 2.8 which is larger than that observed in females, which is 2.5. Males also have a standard deviation of 1, which is also higher than the standard deviation of 0.6 seen in females.\n\nThe effect size between males and females is approximately 0.6 standard deviations.\n",
