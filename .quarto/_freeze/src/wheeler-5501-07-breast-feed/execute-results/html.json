Find more information in the [data dictionary][dd]. This code is placed in the public domain.\n\n[dd]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pmean/datasets/master/breast-feeding-preterm.yaml\n\n## Libraries\n\nYou should always load the tidyverse library. The broom library provides the glance, tidy, and augment functions that help you with computations of linear regression models. The car library provides the vif function for measuring collinearity.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(car)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Question 1: Change the program so that it reads in the breast-feeding-preterm.csv file. Show a glimpse of the data and verify that you have properly read in all 82 rows and 31 columns. No intepretation is necessary for this question\n\nUse the read_csv function to read the data.
